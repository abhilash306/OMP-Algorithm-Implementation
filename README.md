# OMP-Algorithm-Implementation
We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of OMP in reconstructing sparse signals from a limited set of measurements and to explore how varying parameters like the number of measurements (M), the signal length (N), and the sparsity level (K) impact the recovery performance.
